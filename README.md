This is the official issue tracker for TWLan 2.0.

Before posting an issue, please check if the bug or feature you would like to address has been fixed or implemented in the newest version of TWLan. You save us a lot of time this way.

[Click here to see the issue list](https://github.com/TWLan/Issues/issues).

### Bugs

When reporting a bug, please include the following information:

* What exactly do you do?
* What do you expect?
* What do you get instead?

### Features

When requesting a core feature, unless it is an API request, please explain why this should be a core feature instead of a plugin.

Features of the original Tribal Wars that are not available in TWLan should be reported just like other bugs, except for those listed here, which are left out on purpose:

Feature | Reason
------- | ------
Premium Points | Premium features are available to everyone anyway.
Account Manager | The account manager is basically a bot.
