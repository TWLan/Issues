# TWLan/Issues

This is the official issue tracker for the TWLan 2.0.

Before posting an issue, please check if the bug or feature you would like to address has been fixed or implemented in the newest version of TWLan. You save us a lot of time this way.

When reporting a bug, please include the following information:
* What exactly do you do?
* What do you expect?
* What do you get instead?

When requesting a core feature, unless it is an API request, please explain why this should be a core feature instead of a plugin.
Features of the original Tribal Wars that are not available in TWLan are treated as bugs, not as feature requests.
